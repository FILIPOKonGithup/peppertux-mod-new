# hello
if you aren't vaesea, just know the only reason why this is public is because of github actions.

this is basically like tropical paradise in 0.6.3 with 0.7.0 mechanics (because 0.6.3 ci does not work) but it's probably gonna be really bad

if you're from supertux team and you're seeing this, just know this project is not meant for the public to play and see and i respect supertux and supertux team because you all at supertux team are cool people, i just wanted to experiment with an idea i had. this probably wont be finished anyways and the levels will very likely be added to peppertux or something idk. oh also please add a thing to supertux that actually tells the player what went wrong if the game crashes rather than a stacktrace thing that looks like the minecraft enchanting table language. i am LOSING MY FUCKING MIND trying to figure out what's going wrong with the windows build. i know it's something to do with tiles but i just cant fucking find it. replacing tiles with 0.6.3 tiles worked before in timetux.
